- Why would you use GRessource?
 - Make your own symbolic icons
   (only symbolic icons adapt to theme changes
     (dark/light theme))

 - You don't want to care which files go where on the end-user system (/usr, /bin, ...). With GResources everything will become part of the exec file.

  - You want to prevent I/O errors for files the application uses (ui files, icon files, css files, ...)
