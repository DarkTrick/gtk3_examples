This is a collection of examples for GTK3

=== Code style ===

- Mostly GNOME
- "One space before bracket rule"
   - Function definitions / declarations have no space before the bracket.
      - Example: `void setValue(int value) { ... }`
   - Only function calls have a space between name and bracket.
      - Example: `setValue (1);`
   - This makes searching a lot easier.
