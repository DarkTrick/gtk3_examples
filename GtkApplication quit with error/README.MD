## Goal

Instead of starting the app, you just want to show an error and then quit.

## Introduction

Image, you do some checks at app start up and you figure, the app
should not be started. Instead, the user should just be presented
with an error message. `main.c` shows you an example of how to do
that.



## Notes
For a better example on how to create error messages
look at the appropriate example for it.



## Compile:
`sh ./compile.sh main.c`
